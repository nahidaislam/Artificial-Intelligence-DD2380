Question 7 Train an HMM with the same parameter dimensions as above, i.e. A should be a 3
times 3 matrix, etc. Initialize your algorithm with the following matrices:

Does the algorithm converge? 
	When the number of observations are 10 000, the algorithm converges
	after 15 114 iterations.
	When there are fewer observations, the number of iterations are fewer
	but the result is not as good:
	
	#obs	#iter	distance
	
	The result that they converge to (after being rounded up a bit):

	A =~
	1.0 0.0 0.0 
	0 0.7 0.3 
	0 0.13 0.87 
	
	B =~
	1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 
	0.71 0.18 0.09 0.02 
	0.07 0.32 0.25 0.36 

	pi =~
	0.0 0 1.0 
	
	So all of the cases mentioned above sort of converge to the model above.
	It might be that this is a local optimum, or that it's just another model
	that fits those observations.

	While when the number of observations are 10 000, the result is (after being rounded up):
	
	A
	0.7 0.04 0.26 
	0.12 0.75 0.14 
	0.15 0.26 0.59 

	B
	0.7 0.18 0.1 0
	0.1 0.42 0.31 0.17 
	0.03 0.17 0.19 0.61 
	
	pi
	0.0 1.0 0

	which is a lot closer to the actual model the observations were made off of (although pi is off):
	
	A	
	0.7 0.05 0.25
	0.1 0.8 0.1
	0.2 0.3 0.5
	
	B
	0.7 0.2 0.1 0
	0.1 0.4 0.3 0.2
	0 0.1 0.2 0.7

	π
	1 0 0

How many observations do you need for the algorithm to con-
verge?
	If I put in just one observation, it converges in the sense
	that the probability stops improving almost immediately, 
	ie the curve "flattens out" and it doesn't iterate forever.
	However, the answer is obviously wrong (the A matrix is just
	a bunch of NaN-values/non-values).
	
	The number of observations needed for it to converge AND
	for the answer to look more reasonable/numeric is two.
	Here the first two observations are both 2 and therefore
	the B answer is very biased to see just 2:
	0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 
	0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 
	0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 
	
	So with two observations, the algorithm converges and gives
	a numeric answer. However, the answer is very far from the
	actual model since we do not have enough observations to
	infer it.
	
How can you define convergence?
	Convergence can be defined as the moment when the highest
	probability has been obtained, i.e. the probability
	isn't increasing anymore but has flattened out. This might
	happen at the global optimum, but can also happen at a local
	optimum (since the HMM doesn't ensure against this).

	The closest I get is about 5.8 where that is the sum of the
	distance between the A matrices, the B matrices and the pi matrices.
	
What is the problem when it comes to estimating the distance between
these matrices? How can you solve these issues?
	I define the distances between the matrices as the sum of the absolute 
	value of the distance of each value in the matrices. I'm not sure
	what problem you are talking about.

Question 9 Train an HMM with different numbers of hidden states.
What happens if you use more or less than 3 hidden states? Why?
	If I use less than 3 hidden states (I tried 2) then the algorithm
	converges more quickly, usually. If I use more than 3 (I tried 5) it takes a 
	lot longer. (In both cases I still had 4 possible observations and
	an observation sequence of 10000.) In the 2 state situation it took
	approx 600 iterations, in the 5 state it took approx 15 000 - 16 000. 
	They also (of course) landed in very different solutions.
	
	Of course, having only one state or only one possible observation would
	be ridiculous and would not fullfil the properties of an HMM.
		

Are three hidden states and four observations the best choice? If not, why?
	It all depends on what kind of system you are trying to model. However,
	the less states and less number of observations, the more simplistic the 
	model will become. The more states and type of observations, the longer
	time it takes to converge (because the model needs to take more variables 
	into account, and thus becomes more complex).


How can you determine the optimal setting? How does this depend on the amount of data you have?
	The more data I have, the more I will be able to tell which states and 
	observations are important. If, for instance, I see that there is one state
	that the other states almost never go to, I could maybe decide that it isn't an
	important state to take into consideration. If I see that there is one observation
	that is almost never observed in any of the states, I could maybe neglect to use
	that sort of observation, because it happens so rarely. Those are my spontaneous thoughts.
	
	In the book they have an example with a vacuum robot. It can be programmed to move
	by its own accord with an HMM, so it makes the floor a grid and thus the state
	represents (in a discrete sense) where in the room the robot is and the direction which it is going in.
	Thus it might actually need quite a lot of hidden states - upwards of 28 000.

Question 10 Initialize your Baum-Welch algorithm with a uniform distribution. How does this
effect the learning?
	If by "uniform distribution", you mean "every value is completely uniform in the row"
	then the result is this:
	
	// initialised parameters

	B
	0.2641999999999775 0.2698999999999775 0.20849999999997784 0.25739999999997754 
	0.2641999999999775 0.2698999999999775 0.20849999999997784 0.25739999999997754 
	0.2641999999999775 0.2698999999999775 0.20849999999997784 0.25739999999997754 

	pi
	0.33333333333333326 0.33333333333333326 0.33333333333333326 

	Basically, the model doesn't change that much at all and converges
	almost immediately. This is a pretty indifferent model -- it is equally likely
	to start in any state, from any state it is equally likely that you go
	to any of the other states and for each state each observation is as likely
	as any other. It might be that this model is so indifferent that it works
	for any observation sequence and thus serves as a sort of local optimum.
	
	If by "uniform distribution" you mean that each value is a random value from
	a uniform distribution, then that is what I've done in my initialisation before,
	and if I google around it seems to be a pretty standard way of initialising the 
	parameters.
	

Initialize your Baum-Welch algorithm with a diagonal A matrix and π = [0, 0, 1]. How does this
effect the learning?
	The result of that is that we stay in state 2 forever. This means that we don't get information
	about the other states, and the result in the first iteration is this:
	
	A
	NaN NaN NaN 
	NaN NaN NaN 
	0.0 0.0 1.0 

	B
	NaN NaN NaN NaN 
	NaN NaN NaN NaN 
	0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 

	pi
	0.0 0.0 1.0 

	Then eventually the answer just converges to NaN in all matrices.

Initialize your Baum-Welch algorithm with A matrices that are close to the solution. How does
this effect the learning?	
	Makes it go quicker and get closer to the result.
	
	With the parameters you gave us:
	#obs #iter dist
	10000 15114 2.6083846570811575
	
	With parameters close to the truth:
	#obs #iter dist
	10000 3091 0.6288833866443069

	THat is, fewer iterations and shorter distance (dist) to the
	real answer.
